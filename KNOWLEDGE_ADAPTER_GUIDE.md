```python
# Get profit optimization suggestions
recommendations = await agent.get_profit_recommendations()
```

#### Enhance Capabilities
```python
# Upgrade capabilities using learned knowledge
enhanced_caps = await agent.enhance_capabilities_with_knowledge()
```

#### Add Custom Sources
```python
# Add custom knowledge source
success = await agent.add_custom_knowledge_source(
    name="Custom Resource",
    url="https://github.com/example/repo",
    domain_tags=["relevant", "tags"]
)
```

#### Knowledge Summary
```python
# Get current knowledge state
summary = agent.get_knowledge_summary()
```

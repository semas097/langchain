from langchain.agents import create_model_evolver_agent
from langchain.tools import Tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Create tools for model analysis
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="model_analyzer",
        description="Analyze model characteristics",
        func=lambda x: f"Analysis of {x}"
    )
]

# Create the agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = create_model_evolver_agent(llm=llm, tools=tools)

# Use the agent
response = agent.run("Analyze the performance characteristics of a language model")
```
